A GC and Wii Homebrew App to get GBA BIOS, ROMs and saves via the GC GBA Link Cable.  
Save Support based on SendSave by Chishm.  
GBA BIOS Dumper by Dark Fader.  
mod by hiroi01.  

# Usage
Just have a GC Controller in Port 1 and a GBA without a game inserted or aborted game launch by holding select+start in Port 2. 
The bin, gba and sav files dumped will be placed in a folder called "dumps" on your main device (SD Gecko on gamecube and SD/USB on Wii). Please note that dumping GBA ROMs can take a long time (32mb takes about 48 minutes) because of the cable protocol limitations, a estimation will be displayed on screen before you dump it as a reference.

# Modification History
## mod v1.00
Restore the save file **forcibly** even though it has the wrong size.
